## Idea Box Redux
Below is the result of the Mod 1 1904 group project at Turing School of Software and Design. Idea Box Redux is a webpage designed to record ideas which will append on a card in the lower half of the page. These idea  cards are editable and the user can assign qualities of “Swill”, “Plausible” or “Genius” to each idea. The user also has the option to star favorite ideas and to search for specific ideas by title or body content.
